# civitai-toolbox
My personal, but useable, civitai utilities for managing models no matter where I get them from.

# Dumps
I will be uploading a copy of the current crawl for use with the identification of models.  I will be providing a tool eventually that will check a folder for all of the models, hash them with sha256, then scrape them against the api to rename them, sort, and package an entire model into an archiveable folder.
